# Canon D530/D560 CUPS PPD
 A way to use a Canon D530/D560 with CUPS print server via a PPD for Linux ARM distros


# Info
I used this to connect my Canon imageCLASS D530 to my Raspberry Pi 4 using CUPS

## Installation
Install CUPS as you usually would, but then use the PPD from this repo when configuring the printer.

## Printing
Device drivers are still needed on the device sending the print job. Drivers can be found on the official Canon website - https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/products/details/printers/black-and-white-laser/d530

## Known Issues
AirPrint does not work
